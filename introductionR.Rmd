## Overview 
Hopefully, I can give you an idea about the following
>  * What is R?
>  * How does it work? 
>  * Why learn it? 

---

## What is R?
- R is an Open Source environment for statistical computing and graphics
- Available for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux
- R is being actively developed with two major releases per year and dozens of releases of add on packages
- R can be extended with 'packages' that contain data, code, and documentation to add new functionality

```
install packages("foreign")
install_github("slidify", "ramnath")
```

---

## A bit of history
- R is a flavor of the **S** computer language
- S was developed by John Chambers at Bell Labs in the late 1970s
- Version 4 of S, the latest version, was finished in 1998
- In 1991, Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman create R
- R is named for their first initials

---

## John Chambers on the philosophy of S
    
"[W]e wanted users to be able to begin in an interactive environment, where they did not consciously think of themselves as <span class = 'red'>programming</span>. Then as their needs became  clearer and their sophistication increased, they should be  able to <span class = 'red'>slide gradually</span> into programming, when the language and system aspects would become more important."

## Free lunch?
- R is free in many senses
  1. R can be run and used for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, profit or not-for-profit
  2. R's source code is freely available so you can study how it works and adapt it to your needs.
  3. R is free to redistribute so you can share it with your ~~enemies~~  friends
- Try not to think too much as an economist, and consider the social contract
  * Chip in a little...and get a lot back

---

## R advantages
- R is platform agnostic - works with Linux, Mac, PC, etc.
- R can read and write Stata, SPSS, SAS, Excel files
- R is encredibly flexible and can be adopted to almost any need
- You can collect, clean, analyze, vizualize and present data all from within R
- ... and much more depending on interest!

---

## R drawbacks
- R is based on S, almost 40 years old 
- Open source means you have to check packages
- R is a programming language, not a software package--steep learning curve
- R can be slow
- Lack of panel data - and possibly time series - packages

---

## Components of an R setup
- [R](http://cran.r-project.org/) - works, but not easy to work with
- [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/) - a syntax highlighter that makes R much more accessible

---

## How does RStudio look?

---

## R as a calculator
```{r computing,echo=TRUE,results='markup'}
2+2 ## add numbers
2*pi #multiply by a constant
7+runif(1,min=0,max=1) #add a random variable
```

---

## Objects
- Everything in R is an object - even functions and graphs
- Objects can be manipulated in many ways
- This will prove important if you decide to learn R

---

## Let's look at data 
- Look at some data from PWT from 1990-2010 for 6 random countries
```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(pwt)
data(pwt7.1)
myData <- pwt7.1
row.names(myData) <- NULL
names <- unique(myData$country)
c <- as.character(sample(names, 6)) 
myData <- subset(myData, year>1988 & country %in% c)
myData[1:5,1:6]
```

---

## Plots 
We can create two simple plots with the following
```{r, echo=TRUE, cache=FALSE, comment=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(plyr)
library(ggplot2)
myData <- ddply(myData, .(country), transform, Lrgdpch =
                            c(NA, rgdpch[-length(rgdpch)])) 
myData <- subset(myData, year>=1990)
myData$rgdpch1 <- (myData$rgdpch - myData$Lrgdpch)/myData$Lrgdpch*100 

plot1 <- ggplot(myData,aes(x=year, y=rgdpch1,color=country)) + geom_line(size=1)+
  labs(list(title = "", x = "", y = ""))+theme_bw() + 
  theme(strip.text.x= element_text(size = 11), strip.background = element_rect(fill="white"))

plot2 <- ggplot(myData,aes(x=year, y=rgdpch1)) + geom_line(size=1) +
  labs(list(title = "", x = "", y = ""))+theme_bw() + facet_wrap(~ country, scales = "fixed") + 
  theme(strip.text.x= element_text(size = 11), strip.background = element_rect(fill="white")) + 
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept=0), colour="#990000", linetype="dashed")
```

--- 

## Plot1
```{r, echo=FALSE, comment=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot1
```

---

## Plot2
```{r, echo=FALSE, comment=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot2
```

---

## Regressions
- R can do OLS, RE/FE, Arellano-Bond/Bover GMM, etc (use `plm`)
- We can also fix standard errors (robust, cluster)
- We can export results to Tex (use `stargazer` or `apsrtable` )
```{r, echo=TRUE}
ols <- lm(rgdpch1 ~ year, data=myData)
coefficients(ols)
```

## Want to learn more?
- Why not come to the first CopenhagenR session? August 27 somewhere in Copenhagen
- First lecture given by a true expert: Peter Dalgaard
- If you cant wait, a good place to start is this book
